		// Simple : English based, no complex feautres like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances and Explicit memory allocation.
		// Secure : Since there are no pointers, out of bounds arrays are not accessible. Stack corruption or Buffer overflow are not possible to exploit. Independent of OS makes it secure as well.
		// Portable : JVM makes Java portable. 
		// Object Oriented : Collection of objects.
		// Robust : Reliable. Garbage Collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation makes Java robust so checks errors as early as possible.
		// High Performance : Architecture of Java reduces overhead during runtime.
